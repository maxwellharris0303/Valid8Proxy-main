Valid8Proxy is a versatile and user-friendly tool designed for fetching, validating, and storing working proxies. Whether you need proxies for web scraping, data anonymization, or testing network security, Valid8Proxy simplifies the process by providing a seamless way to obtain reliable and verified proxies.

## Features:

1. **Proxy Fetching:** Retrieve proxies from popular proxy sources with a single command.
2. **Proxy Validation:** Efficiently validate proxies using multithreading to save time.
3. **Save to File:** Save the list of validated proxies to a file for future use.

## Usage:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/spyboy-productions/Valid8Proxy.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd Valid8Proxy
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Tool:**
   ```bash
   python Valid8Proxy.py
   ```

5. **Follow Interactive Prompts:**
   - Enter the number of proxies you want to print.
   - Sit back and let Valid8Proxy fetch, validate, and display working proxies.

6. **Save to File:**
   - At the end of the process, Valid8Proxy will save the list of working proxies to a file named "proxies.txt" in the same directory.

7. **Check Results:**
   - Review the working proxies in the terminal with color-coded output.
   - Find the list of working proxies saved in "proxies.txt."

#### If you already have proxies just want to validate usee this:

```
python Validator.py
```

Follow the prompts:

Enter the path to the file containing proxies (e.g., proxy_list.txt).
Enter the number of proxies you want to validate.
The script will then validate the specified number of proxies using multiple threads and print the valid proxies.
